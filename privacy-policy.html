<p>
  This Privacy Policy explains how Quiz-78 Unblocked Games ("Quiz-78", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects

</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
  Quiz-78 does not require you to create an account, and we do not ask you to provide personal information such as your

<p>
  Like most websites, we may collect limited non-personal information automatically through standard web technologies.
  This may include your browser type, device type, approximate location (city/region), pages visited, time spent on
  pages, and referral sources. This information is typically used for analytics, performance monitoring, and security.
</p>

<h2>Cookies and Advertising</h2>
<p>
  Quiz-78 may use cookies or similar technologies to improve site functionality and measure traffic. If we display ads,
  advertising partners (such as ad networks) may use cookies to show relevant ads, limit repeated ads, and measure ad
  performance. These partners may collect non-personal identifiers through cookies or similar tools.
</p>
<p>
  You can control cookies through your browser settings. Please note that disabling cookies may affect some site
  features.

<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>
  We may use analytics tools to understand how visitors use the website so we can improve speed, usability, and content
  quality. Analytics data is generally aggregated and does not directly identify you.

  The site may contain links to third-party websites or embedded content provided by game publishers. We are not
  responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. If you access third-party services, their policies apply.

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  Quiz-78 is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
  believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can remove it.

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
  We take reasonable steps to protect the site and reduce risks such as unauthorized access or misuse. However, no
  website can guarantee complete security.
